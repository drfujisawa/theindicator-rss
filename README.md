# planetmoney-rss

assembles a podcast feed (rss/xml) containing all planet money episodes
  (their official feed only includes the most recent episodes)
by downloading the human-interfacing HTML (which does contain all episodes, surprisingly),
  parsing it into python datatypes (PlanetMoneyHTMLParser), and emitting an xml rss feed

feed available under this link:
    https://xjcl.github.io/planetmoney-rss/npr_pm_feed.xml
