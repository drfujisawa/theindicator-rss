# planetmoney-rss

assembles a podcast feed (rss/xml) containing all planet money episodes
  (their official feed only includes the most recent episodes)
by downloading the human-interfacing HTML (which does contain all episodes, surprisingly),
  parsing it into python datatypes (PlanetMoneyHTMLParser), and emitting an xml rss feed

! entirely hosted on the gh-pages branch, not master

Example of how this feed looks in Podcast Addict:
